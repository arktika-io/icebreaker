# CLI
Icebreaker provides an `icebreaker` Command Line Interface (CLI).

The CLI interface provides functionality that a developer may use during the development process.

## fmt
`icebreaker fmt` re-formats your codebase using a standard, widely-accepted set of rules.

The rules are intentionally not configurable to facilitate consistency across systems.

Run `icebreaker fmt --help` to familiarize yourself with the interface.
